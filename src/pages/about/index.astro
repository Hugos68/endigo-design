      <p>
        Hello and to this showcase of some of my most prominent works. I have
        dedicated the last 20+ years of my life to building a career in
        professional development, design, and UX. I am primarily self taught in
        these disciplines, but still take time to research, tinker, and learn
        more every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I discovered my passion for programming and design while attending
        classes for Visual Basic and Photoshop in high school. I'm also a live
        long fan of video games. Which kicked off when I received my first
        console, a classic Nintendo Entertainment System as a kid. I still
        remember the magic of picking up that controller and making Mario run
        and jump on the screen - though occasionally to his untimely death.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion has fueled a lifelong journey, culminating in a career path
        that includes a broad spectrum of industries, including: photography,
        corporate media, a digital agency, a number of tech startups - all
        before landing in my current role as the core maintainer for <a

        >, a web-based UI toolkit. I’ve since had the privilege to work with
        extremely passionate and talented individuals, helping build major
        platforms and services for the web, gaming, and open source.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel my strength lies not just in writing code or design UI, but in
        solving real world problems. I pride myself in my ability to listen,
        learn, and help determine what is really needed for any given challenge.
        Providing solutions at every step of the way, from concept to execution.
        Whether you’re trying to build a web application, engage your audience,
        or carve a new path in the world. My skills are available to help get
        you to where you need to be!
