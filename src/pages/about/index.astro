              Hello and welcome to showcase of some of my most prominent works.
              I have dedicated the last 20+ years of my life to building a
              career in professional development, design, and UX. I am primarily
              self taught in these disciplines, but still take time to research,
              tinker, and learn more every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              I discovered my passion for programming and design while attending
              classes for Visual Basic and Photoshop in high school. I'm also a
              live long fan of video games. Which kicked off when I received my
              first console, a classic Nintendo Entertainment System as a kid. I
              still remember the magic of picking up that controller and making
              Mario run and jump on the screen - though occasionally to his
              untimely death.
            </p>
            <p>
              My passion has fueled a lifelong journey, culminating in a career
              path that includes a broad spectrum of industries, including:
              photography, corporate media, a digital agency, a number of tech
              startups - all before landing in my current role as the core
              maintainer for <a

                href="https://skeleton.dev/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer">Skeleton</a
              >, a web-based UI toolkit. I’ve since had the privilege to work
              with extremely passionate and talented individuals, helping build
              major platforms and services for the web, gaming, and open source.
            </p>
            <p>
              I feel my strength lies not just in writing code or design UI, but
              in solving real world problems. I pride myself in my ability to
              listen, learn, and help determine what is really needed for any
              given challenge. Providing solutions at every step of the way,
              from concept to execution. Whether you’re trying to build a web
              application, engage your audience, or carve a new path in the
              world. My skills are available to help get you to where you need
              to be!
