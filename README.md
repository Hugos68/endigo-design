## About the Project

This project is the portfolio website for Chris Simmons. It features both modes:

1. An interactive game-like experience. This works similar to 2D top-down perspective RPG games like Zelda or Pokemon.
2. A traditional website with standard navigation.

Either method will let you explore and learn more about me and projects I've contributed to.
